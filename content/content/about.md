I got my bachelor's degree in International Relations and was previously employed as an economic analyst in a government agency in [Jakarta, Indonesia](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/weeks-living-dangerously-jakarta-all-over-again). I left my job as I wanted to pursue higher education. However, the pandemic hit, and I was forced to rethink my plan.

During that time, I (and million others) was forced to took a break. So, I built my own drinkware company while actively looking for a chance to switch my career aspiration.

Despite my bachelor's degree major, I have a lifelong interest in the IT world. So, I decided to enroll for a master's degree in Informatics to restore and solidify my interest. For this reason, I moved to Penang, Malaysia to attend [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my), and I still based in Penang as of 2025.

During my time as a graduate student, I discovered lots of technologies that piqued my interest. But then, I decided to dive deeper into the world of cloud computing, as it essentially is the "backbone" of the internet. Coming from a non-technical background, I always think that "cloud computing" is something like iCloud or Google Drive (though, it's not entirely wrong at all).

Starting fresh, I learned the nuts and bolts of cloud computing, choosing AWS as my vendor of choice, and learned other important things such as Terraform and some programming languages. After some time of learning, I received my AWS [Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03)](https://www.credly.com/badges/7fc0a04b-0e55-4f33-a4ec-030e6dfe540c) certification and built some projects along the way, including this website.

Besides putting my head in the clouds, I am also a football  and history geek. I also love to read, travel, and write in my free time.
